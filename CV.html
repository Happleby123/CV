        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Unreal Engine Developer</strong> - MOOV, London, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>March 2022 - Current</em><br>
           I am currently an unreal engine developer for this company dealing mainly in VR/AR Graphics for sport broadcast television, this includes designing widgets through to developing their functionality, animating, Updating and some interaction. During this time, I have had opportunities to develop my existing skills using unreal engine 4.24 - 5.1 in my day-to-day work. Whilst using C++ to create control software for controlling Unreal remotely and feeding data into the AR graphics from JSON files. Working for this company has also allowed me to learn the ins and outs of customer interaction and the deadlines of working in a creative industry. And the different skills that come with different industries such as broadcasting. <br><br>
            <strong>Tech refurbishment officer</strong> - Books2Africa, Canterbury, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>September 1st 2020 - March 2022</em><br>
           During my time at this job, I have experienced how vital the work a charity like this one does for underprivileged people and the impact it has on helping these people get proper resources for their education.  My job responsibilities were to fix and refurbish technology such as computers and laptops to send to children in need in Africa. My other responsibilities included listing and selling other more expensive technologies like phones, tablets and game consoles as they were unable to be donated to help fund the shipping of books and computers across the world. During this time, I learnt a lot about debugging and trial and error when I encounter a challenge, going through all the possible errors and fixing them.
           <strong>Sandwich artist</strong> - Subway, Norwich, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>August 2019 – March 2021</em><br>
           Whilst at university I was working as a sandwich artist at Subway Norwich part time. During this time, I improved on my team and communication skills, due to working closely with my colleagues whilst always maintaining high communication so that there are no mistakes along the line for the customers, this also requires me to listen to what the customers would want and their feedback to improve upon. Other responsibilities include cleaning and maintain the shops to a good standard, preparing food and closing the shop on my own.

During this game Jam My team had a theme of ‘mirage’. I was a part of a team of five; 2 concept artists, 2 asset designers, 1 level designer and myself<strong> (Gameplay programmer)</strong> and we had 2 weeks to create a working playable prototype. Our game won Best Gameplay and best gameplay mechanic. I oversaw this entire project including implementing the mechanic that won the award, this is showcased on my Portfolio.
