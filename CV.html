        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Unreal Engine Developer</strong> - MOOV, London, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>March 2022 - Current</em><br>
           I am currently employed as an unreal engine developer dealing mainly in VR/AR graphics for sport broadcast television. This role includes designing widgets, developing their functionality, animating, updating, and interaction with virtual sets. During this employment, I have had opportunities to develop my existing skills, using unreal engine 4.24 - 5.1 on a day-to-day basis and support my team fixing bugs for deployment in real time, whilst using C++ to create control software for controlling Unreal remotely, which requires feeding data into the AR graphics from JSON files. Working for MOOV has also allowed me to develop my communication skills with customers and colleagues, highlighting the importance of deadlines, and given me the ability to support and think on my feet in a real time environment, where unreal virtual set AR may need to be developed or upgraded in the moment, to allow for broadcasts to happen seamlessly, especially working in a creative and fast paced industry. This has allowed me to develop niche skills within a broadcasting context and developed my Unreal blueprinting skills to a proficient and exciting level.  <br><br>

            <strong>Tech refurbishment officer</strong> - Books2Africa, Canterbury, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>September 1st 2020 - March 2022</em><br>
           Whilst working for Book2Africa I experienced how vital the work a charity like this one is for underprivileged people, and the impact it has on helping people get proper resources for their education.  My job responsibilities were to fix and refurbish technology, such as computers and laptops, to send to children in need in Africa. My other responsibilities included listing and selling other more expensive technologies like phones, tablets, and game consoles as they were unable to be donated to help fund the shipping of books and computers across the world. During this time, I learnt a lot about debugging and trial and error, when I encountered a challenge, going through all the possible errors and fixing the technology so that it could be used by the charity to a functional level or above.

           <br><br><strong>Sandwich artist</strong> - Subway, Norwich, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>August 2019 – March 2021</em><br>
           Whilst at university I worked as a sandwich artist at Subway Norwich in a part time role to support my studies.  During this time, I improved on my team and communication skills, due to working closely with my colleagues whilst always maintaining high communication so that there are no mistakes along the line for the customers, this also requires me to listen to what the customers would want and their feedback to improve upon. Other responsibilities include cleaning and maintaining the shops to a good standard, preparing food and closing the shop on my own.

           <br><br><strong>Game Tester</strong> - Burke & Best, Canterbury, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>2016</em><br>
           I was selected to test a mobile game for the developers’ Burke and Best in Canterbury which has now been released, during this time I learnt how companies in the industry rely on feedback and were able to gain experience of a game in Beta phase and how it is tested by consumers.

        <h2>Awards and acknowledgements</h2>
        <p>
        
 <strong> Game Jam</strong><br>
In year 2 of university, we were given the opportunity to take part in a Game Jam.  Working in a team we were given the theme of ‘mirage’. I was a part of a team of five; 2 concept artists, 2 asset designers, 1 level designer and myself <strong> (Gameplay programmer)</strong> and we had 2 weeks to create a working playable prototype. Our game won Best Gameplay and best gameplay mechanic. I oversaw this entire project including implementing the mechanic that won the award, this is showcased on my Portfolio. During this time, I learnt how to lead a team in a high-pressure situation, I also learnt how to manage my time and prioritise certain aspects in gameplay during a short time.
