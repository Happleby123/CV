            <em>March 2022 - Current</em><br>
            I am currently an unreal engine developer for this company dealing mainly in VR/AR Graphics for sport broadcast television which includes, designing widgets through to developing their functionality as well as animating, Updating and some interaction. During this time, I have had opportunities to develop on my existing skills using unreal engine 4.24 - 5.1 in my day-to-day work. Also using C++to create control software for controlling Unreal remotely and feed data to into the AR graphics. This has also given me the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of customer interaction and deadlines of working in a creative industry.<br><br>
            <strong>Tech refurbishment officer</strong> - Books2Africa, Canterbury, United Kingdom<br>
            <em>September 1st 2020 - March 2022</em><br>
           During my time at this job I have experienced how vital the work a charity like this one does for underprivileged people and the impact it has on helping people these people.  My job responsibilities were to fix and refurbish technology such as computers and laptops to send to children in need in Africa my other responsibilities included listing and selling other more expensive technologies like phones, tablets and games consoles as they were unable to be donated. During this time, I learnt a lot about debugging and when I encounter a challenge going through all the possibilities and fixing them.

 <strong> Game Jam</strong>
During this game Jam My team had a theme of ‘mirage’. I was a part of a team of five; 2 concept artists, 2 asset designers, 1 level designer and myself<strong> (Gameplay programmer)</strong> and we had 2 weeks to create a working playable prototype. Our game won Best Gameplay and best gameplay mechanic. I oversaw this entire project including implementing the mechanic that won the award, this is showcased on my Portfolio. During this time, I learnt how to lead a team in a high-pressure situation, I also learnt how to manage my time and prioritise certain aspects in gameplay during a short time.
